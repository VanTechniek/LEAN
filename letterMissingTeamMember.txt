Hello professors,

As you are aware our fourth team member Faisal has not been responding to our emails and has now missed 4 class periods with no communication.
He has not contributed towards anything we have done thus far and it does not appear that he will be contributing in the future.
That being said we were asked to analyze if this loss of 25% of our team will change our scope of being able to deliver our original proposal.
We feel that it will do just that, 25% of our team is gone, leaving us 3 team members to do the same work that some teams have 4 or 5
team members doing. Our production, and multitasking capabilities is bogged down that much more. We will have to divide up his work 
between us, thus making it more dificult to deliver requirements in the same timely manner as other groups. That being said we do beleive that 
we can still accomplish our main objectives and are hoping that this hurdle will be overcame, though it would be nice if our situation is
kept in the back of everyones mind just incase our deliverables are lagging in comaprison to other groups who are not facing a reduction in manpower.

As we have been composing this message he has shown up the last two classes, but we do not forsee this being a consistent showing. We need your help of telling Faisal that he needs to show up to class or take further action because we do not have the autority to do so. 

Thank you,

Group 4 - Team LEAN
